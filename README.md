# Morrowind Character Generator

This is a small web-app inspired by u/ihategoose's Improved Morrowind Character Roller. I took the elements of that roller and integrated them into a website to make it quick and easy for anyone to generate a random character profile without having to download and run a script or roll dice.

When the website loads, it will automatically generate a character for you. If you want another character, just click the "Generate New Character" button. To generate a name, click the link to take you to insane0flex's name generator website. I may, in future, decide to integrate that idea into this website but for now their website provides a good resource for name generation.

This is my first time creating a website/web-app so if there are any issues or improvements which could be made don't hesitate to contact me.
